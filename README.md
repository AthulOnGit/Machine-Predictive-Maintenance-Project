# Machine-Predictive-Maintenance-Project
Machine predictive maintenance using machine learning is a proactive approach to managing the maintenance of machinery and equipment. This project involves the application of data analysis and algorithms to predict when a machine is likely to fail, allowing for timely maintenance interventions that can prevent unexpected breakdowns and reduce downtime.
